        <div class="text"> Hi, I’m Kendall! I’m a cat lover with two adorable feline companions who keep me on my toes. I’m also excited to
        be getting married in June 2025 to the love of my life—we’re planning a big, beautiful Irish wedding!

        When I’m not busy with wedding planning, I love spending my free time learning new things and exploring the
        great outdoors. I have a passion for hiking, especially out west, though I prefer to drive there since I’m a bit
        afraid of flying. My longest journey was an unforgettable three-week adventure that took me from Huntington, WV,
        to Denver, Colorado, then back to West Virginia, and finally up to Maine!

        I have a strong interest in coding; I find it exhilarating because there's always something new to discover. The
        thrill of those “aha” moments and the endless stream of knowledge keep me engaged. I never want to reach a point
        where I feel like I’ve learned everything—where’s the fun in that?
